\section{Background}
Consider a dataset $\mathcal{D}$ consisting of $n$ data objects, $[{\bf x_i}]_{i=1}^n$, ${\bf x_i} \in \Re^d$. The {\em dimensionality reduction} operation can be seen as a transformation of $\mathcal{D}$ to $\mathcal{D}'$, where $\mathcal{D'} = [{\bf x'_i}]_{i=1}^n$ and each ${\bf x}_i \in \Re^{d'}$ where $d' < d$. The vector ${\bf x'_i}$ is the {\em reduced} version of the original vector ${\bf x_i}$.

Dimensionality reduction can be done in many ways.
